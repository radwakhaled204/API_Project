# Project Name: Learning API

## Project Overview
This project is an API built as a learning exercise to explore and implement new features, tools, and techniques in backend development. The main goal is to create a functional API that allows for experimenting with various features such as authentication, database interactions, error handling, and more.

---

## Objectives
- **Learn and Apply New Features:** Gain hands-on experience with backend development techniques.
- **Experimentation:** Test and understand how different API features work.
- **Problem Solving:** Solve real-world problems while exploring.
- **Build Reusable Components:** Create components that can be reused in future projects.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Authentication and Authorization**
- Implemented **JWT-based Authentication** to secure the API.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing different user permissions.

### 2. **CRUD Operations**
- Built basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) endpoints for resources.

### 3. **Database Integration**
- Connected the API to a database ( SQL Server).
- Used **Entity Framework Core** for ORM .

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Centralized error handling middleware to handle exceptions gracefully.
- Returned consistent error response formats.

### 5. **Validation**
- Integrated request data validation using libraries like FluentValidation or Data Annotations.

### 6. **Logging**
- Configured logging for debugging and tracking API usage.

### 7. **Testing**
- Wrote unit and integration tests for endpoints to ensure code quality and reliability.

### 8. **Documentation**
- Used **Swagger/OpenAPI** to document the API endpoints for easy reference.
